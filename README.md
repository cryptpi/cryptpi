My dad pushed me to the Software Engineering field when I was 7 years old, he was & still a programmer, I taught physics first which helped me understanding electronics while repairing my electronic devices and ended up doing Software Engineering, I was never the best at school or academics, I'm just a super curious guy spending most of my time learning new concepts in relation with Computer Science.
